			<li>Crisostomo Ibarra</li>
			<p>A wealthy young man of mixed Spanish and Filipino ancestry who has recently returned to the Philippines from Europe after spending seven years studying abroad. Ibarra is cultured and well-respected, though the friars in his hometown of San Diego are suspicious of him. This is because his father Don Rafael was recently imprisoned and labeled a subversive and heretic, a sentence that eventually led to his death in jail. Ibarra learns of this on his first night back in the Philippines.<p>

			<li>Maria Clara</li>
			<p>María Clara, whose full name is María Clara de los Santos, is the mestiza heroine in Noli Me Tángere, a novel by José Rizal, the national hero of the Republic of the Philippines. Her name and character has since become a byword in Filipino culture for the traditional, feminine ideal.María Clara is the childhood sweetheart and fiancée of Noli Me Tángere's main protagonist, Juan Crisóstomo Ibarra y Magsalin, the son of Don Rafael Ibarra. <p>

			<li>Padre Damaso</li>
			<p>A Spanish friar living in the Philippines, Father Dámaso is an arrogant and pedantic priest who, despite having lived amongst Filipinos and hearing their confessions for over twenty years, is barely able to speak or understand Tagalog, the country’s native language. A shameless loudmouth, he is unafraid of slandering nonreligious citizens who he thinks undermine his power.Ibarra learns that this is exactly what happened between his father, Don Rafael, and Dámaso—because Rafael refused to go to confession and supported secular means of empowering Filipino citizens, Dámaso jumped at the opportunity to cast Rafael as a heretic and a subversive. As such, Dámaso is Ibarra’s most evident and outspoken rival, a fact Dámaso seems to leverage by taunting the young man at a dinner party one night, making allusions to Rafael’s death and insulting Ibarra’s project to build a school.<p>

			<li>Sisa</li>
			<p>Sisa is one of the most tragic characters in Noli Me Tangere. Not only does she miss her sons—who are living away from her as mere children—but she is also poor and further disempowered by her abusive husband, who only shows up to deplete her of whatever she may have, as he does by eating the majority of the dinner intended for Basilio and Crispín.In terms of power, Sisa is at the bottom wrung of San Diego’s socioeconomic ladder. To make matters worse, her only allies are her sons, who rarely see her. This means that she’s not only isolated from San Diego’s power structures, but from her own sons, too.<p>
